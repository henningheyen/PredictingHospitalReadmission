# PredictingHospitalReadmission
- The goal of this repo is to provide a realistic setting for a machine learning application. The UCI [dataset]((https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)) includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. 

- The aim is to predict which patients will need hospital readmission. 

- This tutorial covers most steps in the ML pipeline (preprocessing, training, evaluation, interpretation...)
