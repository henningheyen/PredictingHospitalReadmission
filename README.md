# PredictingHospitalReadmission
- The goal of this repo is to provide a realistic setting for a machine learning application. The UCI [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. 

- The aim is to predict which patients will need hospital readmission. 

- This tutorial covers most steps in the ML pipeline:

  - 1 Understanding the dataset

  - 2 Data Assembling and Preprocessing

  - 3 Machine Learning Pipeline
  
  - 4 Alternative Pipeline
  
  - 5 Model Interpretation
  
  - 6 Limitations and potential Solutions
